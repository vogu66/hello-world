# hello-world

Hello, World.
Be happy. Be ready.

This is a repo containing a good number of my hello worlds, for languages I haven't used in a while or languages I've never really worked on a lot, most of the time, so I can get a quick reference on how to start a project or the general syntax of the language, or even just so I can copy/paste it to change it a bit and have a working test more easily if I want to test something.
